**Considerations for Women:**

1. **Premenopausal Women:**
   - During the follicular phase, increase carbohydrate intake due to improved insulin sensitivity. Maintain moderate protein levels for muscle growth.
   - In the luteal phase, reduce carbohydrate intake and increase protein and healthy fats to support muscle maintenance and counteract progesterone's catabolic effects.
   - Supplements for the luteal phase: magnesium, Ashwagandha, Rhodiola Rosea, sodium, and potassium to reduce stress, balance hormones, alleviate PMS-related fatigue, and combat water retention and bloating.

2. **Postmenopausal Women:**
   - Increase protein intake to support muscle mass and counteract declining estrogen effects.
   - Prioritize calcium and vitamin D intake to maintain bone density and reduce osteoporosis risk. Include healthy fats for cardiovascular health.
   - Recommended supplements: calcium (1000-1200 mg/day) and vitamin D (2000 IU/day).
