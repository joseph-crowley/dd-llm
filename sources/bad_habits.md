Move on from Bad Habits

Recognize that bad habits are actions you engage in that do not contribute to your happiness and often lead to feelings of sadness and regret. To effectively move past these habits, follow this structured approach:

1. **Identify and Name the Problematic Version of Yourself**: Determine which version of yourself is responsible for the self-destructive behavior. Give this version a specific name to personify it, such as "Evening Bryan."

2. **Document Persuasion Techniques**: Write down the tactics this version of you uses to justify the bad habit. Examples include thoughts like "tonight is the last night" or "tomorrow weâ€™ll work extra hard to burn off the calories."

3. **Prepare Rebuttals**: Create a list of counterarguments that will help you resist these persuasive tactics. Use statements such as "this is not what we really want" or "we know this makes us sad and regretful."

4. **Assign Authority to a Positive Version of Yourself**: Identify which version of yourself should be in charge of making decisions that align with your goals and well-being. For instance, designate "Morning you" as the authority figure who can override the decisions of "Evening Bryan."

5. **Revoke Authority from the Problematic Version**: Clearly establish that the problematic version, like "Evening Bryan," no longer has the authority to engage in the bad habit. Reinforce that this version cannot act in ways that negatively impact other aspects of your life, such as "Sleep Bryan," "Morning Bryan," "Work Bryan," and "Dad Bryan."

By following these steps, you can effectively manage and move past your bad habits, leading to a more fulfilling and regret-free life.
