How to Care for Your Skin

Recognize that skin is the largest organ of your body and requires proper care to maintain its health and appearance. Implement the following skin care practices to nurture and protect your skin effectively:

1. **Sun Exposure Management:**
   - Get sunlight early in the mornings and later in the afternoons.
   - Avoid direct sun exposure when the UV index is high, typically between 10 am and 4 pm.
   - If you must be in the sun during high UV times, use protective clothing, a UV umbrella, or wear a hat and apply mineral sunscreen.

2. **Lifestyle Habits:**
   - Prioritize getting adequate sleep each night.
   - Follow a healthy diet similar to the Blueprint diet, avoiding junk, fried, and highly processed foods.

3. **Nutritional Supplements:**
   - Consume 20-30 grams of collagen peptides daily, ideally paired with Vitamin C.
   - Consider supplements such as Niacinamide (15 mg) and hyaluronic acid (120 mg) as part of your routine.

4. **Daily Skin Care Routine:**
   - Use a body wash, face wash, and moisturizer for both body and face.
   - Incorporate Vitamin C and Retinol into your skincare regimen.
   - Apply sunscreen daily. Note that Blueprint sunscreen will be available in December 2024.
   - Explore creams containing niacinamide, Vitamin C, hyaluronic acid, and tretinoin (prescription required). Share any significantly effective products you discover.

5. **Additional UV Protection:**
   - Install UV-tinted windows to block 99% of UV rays.
   - Use a UV umbrella when outdoors.

6. **Advanced Treatments:**
   - Consider microdosing Accutane (40mg weekly) for blemish-free skin and anti-aging benefits, with a doctor's prescription. Over-the-counter retinols are alternatives.
   - Engage in red light therapy with three 12-minute full-body sessions per week to promote collagen production, healing, and mitochondrial health.

7. **Measuring Skin Health:**
   - Utilize Multispectral Imaging to assess skin health, tracking UV damage, pore size, and spots. Search for local wellness clinics offering this service.
