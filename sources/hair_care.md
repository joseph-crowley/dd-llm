**How to Care for Your Hair**

1. **Start Early and Be Proactive**: Begin a hair health protocol before you notice any visible hair loss. Understand that by age 20, about 20% of men may have some visible hair loss, and many people lose up to 50% of their hair before noticing thinning. By age 50, up to 40% of women will have noticeable hair loss. 

2. **Focus on Nutrition**: Ensure your diet includes adequate protein, Omega-3 fatty acids, Biotin (Vitamin B7), Vitamin C, Vitamin D, Vitamin E, Iron, and Zinc. Consider using the Blueprint stack, which contains all these nutrients.

3. **Use a Topical Hair Formulation**: Apply 1 mL of a topical solution to your scalp each night. Massage your scalp with a silicon scrubber for 1-2 minutes to stimulate blood flow. Customize your formulation based on a genetic test to predict your response to various ingredients. Be cautious of applying the topical solution twice a day, as it may lower DHT levels excessively and cause side effects. Avoid morning applications to prevent run-off into your eyes. Shower in the morning to clean your scalp before workouts, rinse off after exercising, and apply the topical solution before sleeping. If on a budget, try Minoxidil 5%, but monitor for side effects like itchy skin or headaches.

   - **Ingredients in My Formulation**: Minoxidil (7%), Cetirizine HCl (1%), Latanoprost (0.004%), Dutasteride (0.25%), Melatonin (0.1%), Caffeine (0.2%), Tretinoin (0.0125%), Vitamin D3 (1,000IU/ML), Vitamin E (10 IU/ML).

4. **Use a Red Light Cap**: Wear a red light cap for six minutes daily during your morning routine.

5. **Consider Oral Minoxidil**: Take 3.75 mg daily, starting with 2.5 mg to evaluate side effects. Oral Minoxidil (5 mg daily) has shown similar efficacy to topical Minoxidil (5% solution applied twice daily) in clinical trials. Be aware of potential side effects like hypertrichosis and headaches. Obtain a prescription from Dr. Marjon Vatanchi at Irvine Dermatology if interested.

6. **Explore Gray Hair Reversal**: Use a product that has shown results in reversing gray hair. Share your results to contribute to understanding its efficacy.

7. **Stay Tuned for Blueprint Hair Health Shampoo**: A new formulation is being tested and may be available later this year.

8. **Anticipate Blueprint Hair Treatment**: After limited success with PRP and PRF treatments, a new method is being assessed and may be released later this year.

Monitor for side effects with any new therapy. You may find that topical Minoxidil 5% is sufficient for good results. Share your experiences to help others decide whatâ€™s right for them. Stay informed about emerging hair regrowth therapies, as the future holds promising developments.
