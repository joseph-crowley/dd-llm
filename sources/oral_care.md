**Oral Care Protocol**

1. **Use a Waterpik**: Start your oral care routine by using a Waterpik. Direct a high-pressure stream of water to remove food particles, plaque, and bacteria from hard-to-reach areas. Perform this step both in the morning and at night.

2. **Floss**: Follow up with flossing to remove any remaining plaque and debris. Opt for a thicker floss like Dr. Tongue's, which has been shown to increase plaque removal by over 25% in studies. Floss both morning and night.

3. **Brush Your Teeth**: Use an electric toothbrush for effective cleaning, or choose a manual one if preferred. Select soft bristles to avoid unnecessary harshness on your teeth and gums. Brush twice daily, in the morning and at night.

4. **Apply Toothpaste**: Use toothpaste without fluoride. Apply it during your morning and night brushing sessions.

5. **Use a Tongue Scraper**: Incorporate a tongue scraper into your routine to significantly improve oral hygiene. Use it both morning and night.

6. **Rinse with Mouthwash**: Freshen your breath with mouthwash, especially if you plan to be close to others. Use it in the morning and at night.

7. **Consider Tea Tree Oil**: If needed, mix 2-3 drops of tea tree oil with 2 oz of water for oral health improvement. Discontinue if your oral health baseline is ideal.

8. **Wear a Bruxism Device**: If you grind your teeth at night, use a Bruxism device like the SomnoDent to prevent damage. Wear it while sleeping.

9. **Schedule Regular Cleanings**: Visit your dentist at least twice a year for professional cleanings and early problem detection. This helps remove hardened plaque that home care might miss.

**Oral Hygiene Tips**

- **Reduce Sugar Intake**: Use alternative sweeteners such as Trehalose, Monk Fruit, Xylitol, and Allulose to minimize sugar consumption.

- **Limit Acidic Liquid Exposure**: Avoid prolonged contact with acidic fluids like coffee and lemon water to protect your enamel.

- **Prevent Dry Mouth**: Stay hydrated to maintain saliva production, which helps wash away food debris, neutralize acids, and remineralize enamel.

- **Wait to Brush After Eating**: Delay brushing for 30 minutes post-meal to allow softened enamel to harden.

- **Carry a Travel Toothbrush**: Keep a travel toothbrush handy for on-the-go cleaning throughout the day. Sneak away to a bathroom for a quick brush when needed.
