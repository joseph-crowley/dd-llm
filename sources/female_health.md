**Blueprint for Females**

**FOLLICULAR PHASE:**

Understand that this phase begins on the first day of menstruation and ends with ovulation. Recognize that estrogen levels start low and gradually increase, while progesterone remains low. These hormonal changes lead to increased insulin sensitivity, improved muscle synthesis, lower core body temperature, and faster recovery.

**Protocol: Day 1 to Ovulation**

1. **Training:**
   - Prioritize high-intensity workouts and strength training.
   - Train more frequently due to faster recovery.

2. **Nutrition:**
   - Consume higher carbohydrates to leverage improved insulin sensitivity.
   - Maintain protein intake at 1.5 grams per kilogram of body weight daily.

3. **Supplements:**
   - Follow the Standard Blueprint stack.
   - Take 1200 mg of calcium daily.

**LUTEAL PHASE:**

Acknowledge that during this phase, progesterone rises and peaks after ovulation, while estrogen also rises but decreases before menstruation. Be aware of increased core temperature, insulin resistance, catabolism, water retention, and neurotransmitter changes.

**Protocol: Post Ovulation to Menstruation**

1. **Training:**
   - Focus on zone 2 cardio and easier strength training.
   - Reduce intensity and frequency due to slower recovery.

2. **Nutrition:**
   - Increase protein and healthy fats; reduce carbohydrates.
   - Consume protein at 2.0 grams per kilogram of body weight daily.
   - Include anti-inflammatory foods and manage water retention with electrolytes.

3. **Supplements:**
   - Increase sodium (200-400 mg), potassium (200-400 mg), and magnesium (100-200 mg) daily.
   - Take Ashwagandha (300-600 mg) and Rhodiola Rosea (200-400 mg) daily.
   - Use melatonin (1-3 mg) nightly for sleep and inflammation.

**LATE LUTEAL PHASE:**

1. **Training:**
   - Engage in light training and self-care activities.

2. **Nutrition:**
   - Focus on anti-inflammatory foods and maintain hydration.

**Identifying Ovulation:**

- Monitor basal body temperature for a 0.5 to 1.0-degree increase.
- Observe cervical mucus changes to a clear, slippery, and stretchy consistency.

**PERIMENOPAUSE AND MENOPAUSE:**

1. **Training:**
   - Emphasize strength training and HIIT.
   - Engage in weight-bearing and high-intensity exercises.

2. **Nutrition:**
   - Increase protein intake to 2.0 grams per kilogram daily.

3. **Supplementation:**
   - Continue the regular Blueprint stack.
   - Use Ashwagandha and Rhodiola for stress and mood.
   - Take magnesium (100-200 mg) and calcium (1200 mg) daily.

   - Use Nutty Pudding, Blueberry Nut Mix, Essential Softgels, EVOO, and protein powders.

2. **Avoid During Pregnancy:**
   - Do not use Ashwagandha, Curcumin, Red Yeast Rice, Nicotinamide Riboside, CA-AKG, Glucosamine Sulfate, Creatine, Sodium Hyaluronate, N-Acetyl-Cysteine.

3. **Consider Adding:**
   - Prenatal Vitamin with methylated B vitamins.
   - Magnesium (500-600 mg), Iron (30 mg), Calcium (1200 mg), Omega 3 Fatty Acids DHA/EPA (1000-2000 mg).

4. **Nutritional Recommendations:**
   - Maintain a balanced diet with at least 100 g of protein daily.
   - Avoid processed sugars, raw meat, processed meat, unpasteurized cheeses, high mercury fish, and alcohol.
