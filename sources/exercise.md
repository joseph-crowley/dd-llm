Exercise for a total of 6 hours each week. Dedicate 3 days to strength training and 3 days to cardio. Aim for 150 minutes of moderate cardio activity where you can maintain a conversation, and 75 minutes of vigorous exercise where conversation is difficult. Incorporate flexibility, balance, and mobility exercises into your routine.

Follow these important tips:

1. Avoid injury. Exercise cautiously to prevent serious limitations, body imbalances, and long-term complications. It's better to skip certain activities than risk injury.
2. Establish an exercise habit. Exercise daily without exception, unless you're injured, have a medical condition, or are under doctor's orders. Make it a non-negotiable part of your routine.
3. Focus on strength training, cardio, balance, and flexibility.
4. Stay active throughout the day. After each meal, engage in 5-10 minutes of activity. Every 30 minutes, stand up from your desk and move around.
5. Don't get overwhelmed by exercise details. Prioritize being active in any way possible for significant health benefits.

Considerations for specific groups:

- **Premenopausal Females:** During the follicular phase (first half of the cycle), prioritize high-intensity and strength training as estrogen boosts performance, muscle growth, and recovery. In the luteal phase (second half), focus on lower-intensity activities like Zone 2 cardio and lighter strength training due to higher progesterone levels reducing exercise capacity and slowing recovery.
  
- **Postmenopausal Women:** Emphasize strength training and high-intensity interval training (HIIT) to maintain muscle mass, improve insulin sensitivity, and protect bone density. Weight-bearing exercises are crucial for reducing osteoporosis risk and maintaining functional strength as estrogen levels decline.

Understand the compelling scientific evidence supporting exercise. Regular physical activity significantly enhances life expectancy and overall health. It can reduce the risk of all-cause mortality by 26%-31% and cardiovascular disease by 28%-38%. Muscle strength is a predictor of longevity, with low muscular strength in adolescence linked to a 35% increased risk of early death. Each pound of muscle burns three times more calories than a pound of fat. Engaging in 2-4 times the minimum recommended vigorous physical activity (150-299 minutes per week) lowers all-cause mortality risk by 21%-23%. Combining moderate and vigorous physical activity can achieve a maximum mortality reduction of 35%-42%. Even small amounts of intense intermittent activity, like brief bursts of fast walking or stair climbing, are associated with lower cancer risk.
