How to Have Clean Water

1. Install an alkaline water filtration system. Be prepared for a cost of approximately $1,300. Ensure the system includes the following components:

   - **Carbon Filtration**: Use solid block carbon filters to effectively remove dirt, smaller particles, and volatile organic compounds from the water.

   - **Reverse Osmosis Membrane**: Direct dirty water for disposal. Ensure that the system produces water that is over 85% pure at this stage.

   - **Mixed Bed Deionization**: Utilize this process to eliminate impurities that the reverse osmosis membrane may miss. Achieve laboratory-grade high purity by removing chemicals and pharmaceuticals to parts per billion.

   - **Remineralization and Alkalization**: Infuse the water with coral calcium sand to add over 70 naturally occurring trace minerals.

   - **Coconut Carbon Fiber**: Enhance the taste of the water to make it as natural as possible.
